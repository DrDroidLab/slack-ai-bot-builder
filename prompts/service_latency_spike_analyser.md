# Service Latency Spike Analyser

## Overview

Analyze service latency spikes to identify root causes and provide actionable recommendations for resolution.

## Data Sources to Check

### 1. Application Metrics

- **Response Time**: Check for sudden increases in response times
- **Throughput**: Monitor request rate changes
- **Error Rates**: Look for correlation between latency and errors
- **Resource Utilization**: CPU, memory, and I/O patterns

### 2. Infrastructure Metrics

- **Network Latency**: Check for network congestion or packet loss
- **Database Performance**: Query execution times and connection pool status
- **Cache Hit Rates**: Redis/Memcached performance
- **Load Balancer Health**: Backend server response times

### 3. External Dependencies

- **Third-party API Calls**: Response times from external services
- **CDN Performance**: Content delivery network latency
- **DNS Resolution**: Domain name resolution times

## Analysis Steps

### Step 1: Identify the Spike

1. **Time Range**: Determine when the latency spike occurred
2. **Duration**: How long did the spike last?
3. **Magnitude**: How much did latency increase?
4. **Scope**: Which services/endpoints were affected?

### Step 2: Correlate Events

1. **Deployment History**: Check if recent deployments correlate with the spike
2. **Traffic Patterns**: Analyze request volume and patterns
3. **Infrastructure Changes**: Review recent infrastructure modifications
4. **External Factors**: Check for external service outages or issues

### Step 3: Root Cause Analysis

1. **Application Level**:

   - Code changes that might affect performance
   - Memory leaks or resource exhaustion
   - Inefficient database queries
   - Cache invalidation issues

2. **Infrastructure Level**:

   - Resource constraints (CPU, memory, disk I/O)
   - Network issues or bandwidth limitations
   - Load balancer configuration problems
   - Auto-scaling issues

3. **External Dependencies**:
   - Third-party service degradation
   - Database connection pool exhaustion
   - Cache service performance issues

## Investigation Commands

### Check Application Logs

```bash
# Check for errors during the spike period
kubectl logs -n <namespace> -l app=<app-label> --since=<time-range> | grep -i error

# Check for slow queries
kubectl logs -n <namespace> -l app=<app-label> --since=<time-range> | grep -i "slow\|timeout"
```

### Check Resource Usage

```bash
# Check pod resource usage
kubectl top pods -n <namespace>

# Check node resource usage
kubectl top nodes
```

### Check Network Connectivity

```bash
# Test network latency to external services
ping <external-service>
curl -w "@curl-format.txt" -o /dev/null -s <endpoint-url>
```

## Recommendations Template

### Immediate Actions

1. **Scale Resources**: If resource constraints are identified
2. **Restart Services**: If memory leaks or stuck processes are suspected
3. **Rollback Changes**: If recent deployments correlate with the spike
4. **Enable Circuit Breakers**: For external dependency issues

### Long-term Improvements

1. **Monitoring Enhancements**:

   - Add latency alerts with proper thresholds
   - Implement distributed tracing
   - Set up performance dashboards

2. **Architecture Improvements**:

   - Implement caching strategies
   - Optimize database queries
   - Add retry mechanisms with exponential backoff

3. **Operational Improvements**:
   - Implement blue-green deployments
   - Add health checks and readiness probes
   - Set up automated scaling policies

## Placeholder Values

- `<namespace>`: Replace with actual Kubernetes namespace
- `<app-label>`: Replace with actual application label
- `<time-range>`: Replace with actual time range (e.g., "1h", "30m")
- `<external-service>`: Replace with actual external service URL
- `<endpoint-url>`: Replace with actual endpoint URL

## Expected Output

Provide a comprehensive analysis including:

1. **Root Cause**: What caused the latency spike?
2. **Impact Assessment**: Which services/users were affected?
3. **Immediate Actions**: What should be done right now?
4. **Prevention Measures**: How to prevent similar issues?
5. **Monitoring Recommendations**: What metrics to track going forward?
